## Implementation Guide

### 3.1 Data Storage in Git

All files, including code, documentation, and other digital assets, must be stored within Git repositories hosted on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or self-hosted alternatives. This ensures that all data is versioned, backed up, and can be easily shared or collaborated upon.

| Element                 | Implementation Details                                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Backup and Redundancy   | Automated backup systems ensure availability across distributed platforms.                                  |
| Self-Hosting            | For critical data, self-hosted repositories can be utilized to maintain control over sensitive information. |
| Repository Optimization | Regular audits and performance checks will be conducted to ensure optimal repository efficiency.            |

Considerations:

* Technical Expertise: Ensuring proper encryption management via tools like `git-remote-gcrypt `necessitates technical proficiency, potentially requiring additional staff training.
* Local-First Synchronization: Tools like Obsidian and AnyType support local storage while synchronizing with Git for ongoing version tracking, ensuring seamless collaboration across teams.
